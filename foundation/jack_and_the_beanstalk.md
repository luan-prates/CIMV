## Jack and the Beanstalk

Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her son Jack. One day, Jack’s
mother told him to sell their only cow. Jack went to the market and on the
way he met a man who wanted to buy his cow. Jack asked, "What will you
give me in return for my cow?" The man answered, "I will give you five magic
beans!" Jack took the magic beans and gave the man the cow. But when he
reached home, Jack’s mother was very angry. She said, "You fool! He took
away your cow and gave you some beans!" She threw the beans out of the
window.

Jack was very sad and went to sleep without dinner. The next day, when Jack
woke up in the morning and looked out of the window, he saw that a huge
beanstalk had grown from his magic beans! He climbed up the beanstalk and
reached a kingdom in the sky. There lived a giant and his wife. Jack went
inside the house and found the giant’s wife in the kitchen. Jack said, "Could
you please give me something to eat? I am so hungry!" The kind wife gave him
bread and some milk. While he was eating, the giant came home.

The giant was very big and looked very fearsome. Jack was terrified and went
and hid inside. The giant cried, “Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of a boy. Dead
or alive, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!”, but the wife said, “There is no
boy in here!” So, the giant ate his food and then went to his room. He took
out his sacks of gold coins, counted them and kept them aside. Then he went
to sleep. In the night, Jack crept out of his hiding place, took one sack of gold
coins and climbed down the beanstalk.
