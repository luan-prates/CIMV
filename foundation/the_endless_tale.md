## The Endless Tale

In the Far East there was a Great King who had no work to do. Every day, and
all day long, he sat on soft cushions and listened to stories. And no matter
what the story was about, he never grew tired of hearing it, even though
many of the stories took hours to complete. “There is only one fault with your
story,” he often said, “it is too short.” All the storytellers in the world were
invited to his palace; and some of them told stories that were very long
indeed.

But The King was always sad when the story ended. At last he sent a message
to every city and town, offering a prize to any one able to tell him an endless
tale. He said: “To the man that will tell me a story which lasts forever, I will
give my daughter as his wife; and I will make him my heir, and he shall be king
after me.” But this challenge wasn’t quite what it seemed. The King added a
strict condition. “If any man tries to tell such a story and fails, then his head
will be cut off.”

The King's daughter was very beautiful, and many young men in The
Kingdom were willing to do anything to win her. But none of them wanted to
lose his head, and so only a few tried for the prize. One young man invented
a story that lasted three months; but after that, he could think of nothing
more. His fate was a warning to others, and it was a long time before another
storyteller was daring enough to take the King's challenge.

One day a Stranger from the South came to The Palace. “Great king,” he said,
“is it true that you offer a prize to the man who can tell a story that has no
end?” “It is true,” said The King. “And will this man have your daughter for his
wife, and will he be your heir?” “Yes, if he succeeds,” said The King, “but if he
fails, he will lose his head.” “Very well, then,” said the Stranger. “I have a
pleasant story about locusts.” “Tell it,” said The King. “I will listen to you.”

The storyteller began his story. “Once upon a time a certain king seized all
the corn in his country, and stored it in a strong granary, but a swarm
of locusts came over the land and saw where the grain was stored.
After searching for many days, the locusts found a small crack on the east
side of the granary, but the opening was just large enough for one locust
at a time to pass through. So, one locust went in and carried away a
grain of corn; then another locust went in and carried away a grain of corn;
then another locust went in and carried away a grain of corn.”

Day after day, week after week, the Stranger kept on saying, “Then another
locust went in and carried away a grain of corn.” A month passed. A year
passed. After two years, The King asked, “How much longer will the locusts
be going in and carrying away corn?” “Oh, King!" said the Stranger, “the
locusts have only cleared a few inches, and there are thousands of inches in
the granary."

“Man, man!" cried The King, “You will drive me mad. I can listen to it no
longer. Take my daughter, be my heir, and rule my Kingdom, but do not let
me hear another word about those incessant locusts!" So, the Stranger
married The King's daughter and lived happily in the land for many years;
however, his father-in-law, The King, did not care to listen to any more
stories.
