## The Endless Tale

In the Far East there was a Great King who had no work to do. Every day, and
all day long, he sat on soft cushions and listened to stories. And no matter
what the story was about, he never grew tired of hearing it, even though
many of the stories took hours to complete. “There is only one fault with your
story,” he often said, “it is too short.” All the storytellers in the world were
invited to his palace; and some of them told stories that were very long
indeed.
