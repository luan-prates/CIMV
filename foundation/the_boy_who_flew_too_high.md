## The Boy Who Flew Too High

The underground paths housing the Minotaur beneath the isle of Crete were
created by the dangerous and intelligent mind of Daedalus, an artist of
design and construction. Daedalus was so brilliant that King Minos of Crete
kept him as a prisoner. Daedalus lived with his son Icarus in a tower of the
palace, and King Minos made him build tremendous weapons of war.
Although Daedalus and Icarus had a very comfortable life in the tower of the
palace, the father wished to return home to Athens. His son hardly
remembered Athens, but he dreamed of running and playing in the open.
